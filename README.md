## Background
This time we will work on a project from a client, Social Buzz. Social Buzz is a fast-growing tech unicorn that needs to adapt quickly to its global scale. To kick off our involvement with Social Buzz, we ran a 3 month kickoff project to prove to them that we were the best company to work with.

They are expecting the following: 
* An audit of their big data practice 
* Recommendations for a successful IPO 
* An analysis of their content categories that highlights the top 5 categories with the largest aggregate popularity.

## Problem Statement
Analysis to find the top 5 categories of content in Social Buzz. Every 100.000 pieces of content per day. How do we capitalize on it when there is so much?

## Dataset
The data provided by the client consists of 3 different datasets, namely Content.csv, Reactions.csv, and ReactionTypes.csv. After getting the data, the data just needs to be cleaned and prepared, then the three data are combined into one new CSV dataset file by taking out the columns that are important for data analysis.
#### Features of the dataset that has been combined 
* `Content ID`: Contains content id
* `Reaction Type`: The type of reaction given
* `Datetime`: date month and year
* `Content Type`: The type of content provided
* `Category`: content type category
* `Sentiment`: describes the attitudes, feelings, or views expressed by the content
* `Score`: score of sentiment

#### Summary
##### Analysis
Travel and Science are two popular content categories, with people showing interest in holidays and science.
##### Insight
Cooking is a common theme that is included in the top 5 categories with “Healthy Eating”. This indicates that the audience is within the user base. You can use this insight to create campaigns and work with chefs to share healthy food recipes to boost user engagement.
##### Next Movement
These ad-hoc analyses provide deep insights, but it's time to take them into large-scale production to understand your business in real-time. We can show you how to do this.
